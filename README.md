# Yelp-Data-Challenge

In this project, we explore the yelp dataset and attempt to solve two challenging tasks. The goal of Task 1
is to construct a personalized recommender system for the Yelp dataset that can accurately predict a userâ€™s
preference for a business. We have implemented three different methods for our recommendation system, with
Collaborative Filtering as the baseline and additional Content-based and Social Network Recommendation
techniques to boost it. For the task 2, we try to predict the categories of a business based on the reviews of a
business. This is a multi-label classification problem, as each of the businesses has multiple categories.
